# Battleships

The final javascript project on The Odin Project. This project was intended to be done with TDD, which I followed until the UI part of the project. Kind of a different change of pace for me, but I really want to make my tests more meaningful because honestly they were kinda dumb. Practice makes perfect and possibly working in a more professional manner will teach me how to write good tests and not simply fulfilling a goal of writing tests.

Since I have had a hobbyist gamedev background this project was kind of a no nonsense project for me, dealing with 2D grids is my speciality! The hardest part was finishing the background stuff and then working on the UI, after dinking around for a month on DSAs I kinda forgot how to even write html, css, and front end javascript! Took me a second but I was back on track. Another hard part of this project was staying focused, I'm diverting and going to learn ruby and rails, so I'm excited to learn some backend stuff. Gonna go off the path of Odin for a bit because honestly I find it a little too simple for me so I'll still be doing the projects for ruby but won't be going through all the resources until I hit the rails section.

Thanks for reading!
